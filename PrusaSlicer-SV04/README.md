## Presets for SV04 in PrusaSlicer

NOTE: These presets probably requires John Carlson's SV04 firmware (I used these on v2.1.3.1b3 initially)

These presets are a work in progress. They work kind of ok, but there's room for improvement, especially with the tool changing. Currently, both nozzles stay heated for faster switching.

The print settings-presets use some of my other scripts from GitHub - If you don't want to use those scripts, just remove them from "Print Settings" - "Output options" - "Post-processing scripts".

### Installation

On Windows, the "PrusaSlicer" folder is at "%APPDATA%\PrusaSlicer".
