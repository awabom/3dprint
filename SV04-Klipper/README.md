# Sovol SV04 - Notes

Work in progress. Based on the work of https://github.com/Bully85/Sovol-SV04-Klipper and some parts from https://ellis3dp.com/Print-Tuning-Guide/articles/index_useful_macros.html

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. This is only tested on my personal machine. If your printer breaks, don't blame me.

## Main Features 

 * Tool change moves both heads at the same time for faster tool change. 
 * Pre-heat inactive toolhead from PrusaSlicer's added M104.1 commands.
 
* Missing: Copy / Mirror modes.

## Config files for Klipper

These files can be edited via Mainsail and just edited directly into the printer by editing existing, and creating new files:

 * Files here: [Klipper/](Klipper/)

## PrusaSlicer Profiles

Based on Prusa XL 2T.

 * Files here: [Profiles/](Profiles/)
